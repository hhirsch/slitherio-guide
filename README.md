# How to get long in Slither.io
Slither.io is an exercise in self discipline and tests the control you have over your greed and anger.
## Coming to terms with the limitations of abstract representation
This text tries to translate direct experience to abstract ideas. This means the absolute truth can't be
in here because it is unlikely the author knows it and second if he knew it then it would be impossible to
translate this direct experience into words.
Because of that I urge you to try new ideas and to explore the game fresh each time you start it.

## Coming to terms with the limitations of the game
Develop your idea of what the game is and is not. The game is just a bunch of pixels moving to your input.
It does not have the power to make you happy or sad. The most it can do for you is teach you something about
yourself the least it will do is distract you from your suffering. However your problems are still there when
you will quit the game so you might as well embrace your problems first and accept them before looking
for distractions. You don't want to bring negative emotions from outside into the game.

## Come to terms with your limitations
Before you even start your first game you should develop an awarenes that you will probably suck at the game
for a long time. Sucking at the game is part of the process. You will also die a lot.
Enjoy the game. It is still a lot of fun even when you die a lot. And most of the time when you die you will
make other players very happy so be happy for them.

## Your journey to the center
You'll spawn on a random location on the map. Right after your birth the stakes are low so you
can try to get some kills. Usually on your way to the center you will be attacked in an unskillful
way and it can easily be dodged and often the attacker pays with his live and can be consumed.
On your journey you obviously want to take paths where you can find food. If there is a lot of food in 
a line you can use it as a chance to boost but you don't have to. However you don't need a lot of 
lenght/boosting power on the journey and at the center so feel free to use up most of your lenght to
get to the center quickly.

## Dog eats Dog at the center
At the center you will find an agglomeration of snakes. Dodge the other snakes avoiding especially their
head. If they attack you and you are big enough you can form a loop with your body. If they are way bigger
than you are then instead of racing their head move towards their tail you'll often find a way to get away from
the snake there. Then you can boost out of reach of that particular snake.

Once you have brought some space between you and some of the more aggresive snakes it is time to lurk around
bigger snakes looking for bodies to consume.

## Skillful eating
At the center you will be confronted with a lot of temptations. Food is plentiful here and the incentive to boost is big.
Just remember that if you are dead then you'll lose all of your points. Always remember this before boosting to get the
most bites out of a corpse.

To get more peace and quiet you might even want to stray to the outer regions of the map. However I was never able to
get as many points there as I got in the center.

## Coming to terms with death
There are plenty of situations in the game where you can not avoid dying or you lack the skill to do so. 
Don't beat yourself up over it. It means you can start all over and experience all the different stages again.

If you are surrounded by a bigger snake and it is slowly closing in on you use the situation to try to charge for its head.
